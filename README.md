## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- A Spotify Developer Account (for Spotify integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vibe-vision.git
   cd vibe-vision
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

3. **Set up Spotify App** (optional)
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Add `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/auth/callback/spotify` to redirect URIs
   - Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

4. **Environment Variables**
   Create `.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Spotify API Configuration
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here

   # NextAuth Configuration  
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3001` (note: use 127.0.0.1, not localhost for Spotify auth)

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Enable Microphone**: Click "Enable Microphone" to start visualizing ambient audio
2. **Connect Spotify**: Login with your Spotify account to see currently playing tracks  
3. **Switch Modes**: Try different visualization modes (Spectrum, Oscilloscope, Bars, Particles)
4. **Go Fullscreen**: Click the fullscreen button for an immersive experience
5. **Switch Audio Sources**: Toggle between microphone and Spotify as your audio source

## üé® Visualization Modes

- **Spectrum**: Classic frequency analyzer with color gradients
- **Oscilloscope**: Waveform display showing signal amplitude over time
- **Bars**: Circular frequency bars with rotating camera and color cycling
- **Particles**: Dynamic particles that react to audio intensity and frequency

## üîß Development

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```
